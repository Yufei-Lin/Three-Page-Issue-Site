    <h1>Why is equality important?</h1>
    <p class="p1">Inequalities based on income, sex, age, disability, sexual orientation, race, class, ethnicity, religion, and opportunity continue to persist across the world, within and among countries. Inequality threatens long-term social and economic development, harms poverty reduction, and destroys peopleâ€™s sense of fulfillment and self-worth. This, in turn, can breed crime, disease, and environmental degradation.</p>
    <p class="p1">Most importantly, we cannot achieve sustainable development and make the planet better for all if people are excluded from opportunities, services, and the chance for a better life.</p>
