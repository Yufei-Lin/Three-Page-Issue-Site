    <h1>What is equality?</h1>
    <p class="p1">Equality is about ensuring that every individual has an equal opportunity to make the most of their lives and talents.</p>
    <p class="p1">It is also the belief that no one should have poorer life chances because of the way they were born, where they come from, what they believe, or whether they have a disability.</p>
    <p class="p1">Equality recognises that historically certain groups of people with protected characteristics such as race, disability, sex and sexual orientation have experienced discrimination.</p>
