    <h1>We have made huge progress towards a more equal society.</h1>
    <p class="p1">  Today the vast majority of us are studying, working, or making friends with people from other ethnic backgrounds. Some outdated stereotypes about women have begun to fade. Minority ethnic groups which used to lag far behind in educational performance have begun to catch up. There have been huge changes in attitudes towards lesbian, gay, and bisexual people. Disabled people also have more rights than ever before. The social model of disability proposes that barriers, negative attitudes, and exclusion by society are the real factors defining who is disabled and who is not.</p>
    <p class="p2">  However, we still have a long way to go to make our world more equal.</p>
